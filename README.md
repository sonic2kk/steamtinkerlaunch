# Summary

<img align="left" width="64" height="64" src="https://github.com/frostworx/repo-assets/blob/master/pics/steamtinkerlaunch-logo_64px.png" alt="**SteamTinkerLaunch** is a Linux wrapper tool for use with the Steam client">

**Steam Tinker Launch** is a Linux wrapper tool for use with the Steam client
which allows customizing and start tools and options for games quickly on the fly *(see [Features](#Features))*

By using a versatile configuration structure it is both easy to set up and flexible.

## Description 
_(by TaylorRoyal23 on [r/linux_gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/ud58i2/comment/i6i3yf9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))_

"An incredible wrapper with a menu that lets you easily toggle and modify various settings for games on Linux.
Anything from proton versions, to startup and exit scripts, proton/dxvk/etc. settings, FSR, reshade,
and even options for various tools like gamemode, replay-sorcery, gamescope, etc. Tons more too.
I just set my default proton version to "steam tinker launcher" and then every game launches
with a 2 second menu that allows you to easily change any of the settings.
If you don't press any buttons it just goes with the defaults and launches the game.
The menus can get a little confusing but it consolidates it all in one place and is way more simple
than trying to remember dozens of commands for various settings that one might need."

## How to use

### General usage
**steamtinkerlaunch works with Linux native games and with games using Proton!**
*(Some features (f.e. [ReShade](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/ReShade)) are only available for games using Proton)*
*(Non-Steam games added to Steam are supported as well)*

There are two ways to use **steamtinkerlaunch** with Steam.
Either as [Steam Launch Option](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Steam-Launch-Option) or as [Steam Compatibility Tool](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Steam-Compatibility-Tool)
*(simply enabling it as global default [Steam Compatibility Tool](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Steam-Compatibility-Tool) works fine as well)*

**I recommend the [Steam Compatibility Tool](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Steam-Compatibility-Tool) for all Proton games and
the [Steam Launch Option](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Steam-Launch-Option) only for native Linux games.**

*(of course you're using this tool at your own risk and you're responsible which 3rd party programs you launch with it)*

### Game specific use
When starting a game a small [Wait requester](#Wait-Requester) will pop up.
If within a short waiting period *(default 2 seconds)* the spacebar is pressed the [Main Menu](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Main-Menu) will open where everything can be configured comfortably.
When done with configuring (or when the requester timeouts) the game will be started regularly with all tools and options configured.

## Quick start
When **steamtinkerlaunch** is started for the first time it will create its default [configuration](#Configuration) structure.
Almost everything can be configured with the built-in [Main Menu](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Main-Menu), but optionally also with a graphical text editor.
It might be a good idea to start with configuring everything in the [Main Menu](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Main-Menu) to your needs

**If you want to get an overview over the Steam Tinker Launch features, but the huge [wiki](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki) is too overwhelming,

## Features
- [Feature list](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki#features)
- [Changes in the latest release](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/releases/latest)
- [Changelog](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Changelog)


## Requirements
See [Installation](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Installation)
 
## Configuration
All [Configuration Files](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Configuration-Files) are self-contained documented and always growing, so not every option is documented in here.
For a general overview what can be configured, just check the [wiki](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki) or simply browse through the 
[Main Menu](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Main-Menu), which covers almost everything available.

### Wait requester
The initial [Wait Requester](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Wait-Requester) acts as gate to the [Main Menu](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Main-Menu).
If selected within a [timeout](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Wait-Requester#timeout) the [Start Menu](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Start-Menu) will open,
else the game starts seamlessly with all configurations set.

### Logs
Logs are written into the `LOGDIR` defined in the [Global Menu](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Global-Menu) / [Global Config](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Configuration-Files#Global-Config).
The verbosity of the logfile depends on `WRITELOG` *(write logfile if not 0, increase verbosity from 1-2 (1:less, 2:all))*
in the same location.
There are several logfiles, those which are written mostly are the game specific ones *($SteamAppId.log)*
Besides some other (possibly relevant) log files, the log file of the last run can also be found here:
`/dev/shm/steamtinkerlaunch/steamtinkerlaunch.log`

**steamtinkerlaunch** also has several [command line](https://github.com/frostworx/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Command-Line) which can also be useful outside steam.
